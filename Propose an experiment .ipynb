    "If we take data from this set and add a wider range of ages, as well as a higher sample of all ages, we can test for a corrlelation between a lot of the variables and willingness to spend. This could be useful to help bars in this area attract a clientele willing to spend the most amount of money. We would expect willingness to spend to go up as people get older and then hit a peak around middle age and drop back down again. We would expect income to increase directly with willingness to spend. We would expect men to spend more money than women. We would expect people who are working to spend more than students and so on."

    "**Rollout Plan**: Our new experiment needs to try and fix some of the issues we found in the data set. Online rollout similar to the one used in the original is probably fine because people who use the internet are likely to have at least similar age demographics to people who frequent pubs (younger people use computers more often and also spend more time out drinking). \n",
    "\n",
    "The major issue is it seems the experiment was only advertised to students in either a specific area of the capital or a specific school. There will need to be an overhauled advertisement scheme in order to diversify the demographics in the area. Putting fliers for the survey website in all the bars in the area is likely a good method to increase the variance in the demographics. Since this is no longer related directly to a school, there will need to be some sort of incentive so the people reading the flier will respond. A sweepstakes is probably the most cost efficient way to do this. Something like \\$200 gift card to your favoirte bar for 5 winners.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick google search says the population of Armenia, where this survey was taken, is almost 3 million. Using a 95% confidence interval and confidence level, we would need a sample size of roughly ten thousand people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are completely changing up the advertisement scheme of the survey, it is hard to say how long the experiemnt will need to take place in order to acquire a reasonable sample size. Our advertisement method is much farther reaching, so we will assume twice as many people will respond each week or 172*2=344 from the original survey. With this assumption, we will need to run the survey for 29 weeks, or just over 7 months. Obviously this assumption will need to be tested as the results are collected but this is a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the new rollout plan, it is important to test to see if people are filling in duplicates in order to enter the sweepstakes multiple times. The best way is to block an entry from an ip once there has already been one entry. There should also be a mandatory name and date of birth, or something along those lines, to see if people with multiple phones or computers are entering more than once."
